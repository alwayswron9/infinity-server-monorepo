5. Performance benchmarks are met
6. Documentation is updated
7. Code review approved
8. Deployed to staging environment successfully

- **Data Migration**: Automated database migration testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Fixed epic boundaries with clear acceptance criteria
- **Technical Debt**: Automated code quality checks and refactoring cycles
- **Integration Issues**: Comprehensive integration testing between packages
